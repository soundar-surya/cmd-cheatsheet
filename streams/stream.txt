	- inputs, outputs are stream of text
	- stdin, studout, stderr
	
	
Note:								  
	>   - Copies the content			 
	>> - Appends the content			 

Output Stream example:
	- echo "Hello" 1> log.txt
	- here, output of echo is passed as an input to a file.
	- output of one program/file is passing as an input to another file.(Now a file called log.txt will be created with a text "Hello")
	- 1 : stdout (only for stdout).
	- 2 : stderr(only for error).
	- ">" alone is used for processing both out and err in the same destination.
	
Input Stream example:
	- example: grep -i "hi\." < [filename].
	- Here, the content of the file is passed as an input to grep. and grep checks for the match
